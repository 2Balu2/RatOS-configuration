# The first thing you'll need to do is go through this file and comment out / uncomment 
# the files and/or settings you need.
# You'll be able to print just fine with this config as it is, but it is recommended
# that you follow these steps to properly calibrate your printer:
# 0) Sanity check and PID Tuning: https://www.klipper3d.org/Config_checks.html
# 1) Pressure Advance: https://www.klipper3d.org/Pressure_Advance.html
# 2) Skew Correction: https://www.klipper3d.org/skew_correction.html
# 3) Resonance Compensation: https://www.klipper3d.org/Resonance_Compensation.html

### CONTROL BOARD
[include v-core-3/boards/btt-skr-14-turbo/config.cfg]

### BASE SETUP
[include v-core-3/printers/v-minion/v-minion.cfg]
[include v-core-3/printers/v-minion/steppers.cfg]

### Stepper mechanical overrides
[stepper_x]
dir_pin: !x_dir_pin # Add ! in front of pin name to reverse X stepper direction
rotation_distance: 40 # 40 for 20 tooth 2GT pulleys, 32 for 16 tooth 2GT pulleys

[stepper_y]
dir_pin: y_dir_pin # Add ! in front of pin name to reverse Y stepper direction
rotation_distance: 40 # 40 for 20 tooth 2GT pulleys, 32 for 16 tooth 2GT pulleys

[stepper_z]
dir_pin: !z0_dir_pin # Add ! in front of pin name to reverse Z stepper direction
rotation_distance: 4 # 4 for TR8*4 lead screws

[extruder]
dir_pin: e_dir_pin # Add ! in front of pin name to reverse extruder direction

# Uncomment this next line if you have an ADXL345 connected to the SKR PRO
#[include sensors/adxl345.cfg] 

### HOMING
# BL Touch
[include v-core-3/z-probe/bltouch.cfg]
[bltouch]
z_offset: 0.0 # Adjust this to fit your setup

# Inductive/Capacitive probe
#[include v-core-3/z-probe/probe.cfg]
#z_offset: 0.0 # Adjust this to fit your setup
#pin: ^!probe_pin # Change this to suit your probe (NPN/PNP NO/NC) if necessary.

# Physical endstops
[include v-core-3/printers/v-minion/physical-endstops.cfg]
[safe_z_home]
home_xy_position: 80,80

# Endstop position
# Adjust this to your setup
# Note: might need fine tuning.
[stepper_y]
position_endstop: 0
position_min: 0
position_max: 180 

[stepper_x]
position_endstop: 0
position_min: 0
position_max: 180

# Sensorless homing (Beware: this requires manual tinkering and does not work if your x/y stepper drivers
# have clipped DIAG pins). It is strongly encouraged to use physical endstops if you're a beginner.
# If you still wish to proceed, copy v-core-3/templates/sensorless-homing.cfg to the root directory and 
# remove the # from the line below.
#[include sensorless-homing.cfg]

# OR SIMILARLY POWERFUL STEPPERS (2.5A rating at least).
